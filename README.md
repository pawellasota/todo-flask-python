# ToDo Application

Todo application allows to maintain a list of tasks that have priorities and text description.

There are two users initially:

* 'user' with password 'pass'
* 'user2' with password 'pass' 
* 'manager' with password 'pass'

After logging in the user sees todo lists displayed and can choose list of todo's items or add new list.

In particular list he can manipulate todo items (add/remove/modify entries/set priority/add due date/remove list). 
Todo items have creation date and are sorted by priority also.
There are 10 levels of priority (1-10).

After logging in as manager lists of users are displayed with lists of todo's allowed for modify to them.
Manager is able to assign or remove particular list to user.

#Getting Started

To get started, you'll want to first clone this GitHub repository locally:

    $ git clone https://github.com/CodecoolKrakow20161/python-flask-todo-pawellasota

Install virtualenv(optional) - enables multiple side-by-side installations of Python, one for each project.
    
    $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv

Create database 'db' in SQLite3, then import sql database from sql file located at /db/script.sql.
You can use DBBrowser utility to handle it.

Start application by execute main.py

    $ python3 main.py

You should see something like this:

    $ Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    $ Restarting with stat
    $ Debugger is active!
    $ Debugger pin code: 460-646-704
 
Now server is listening default in port 5000 in your localhost, so start app by writing in your
browser localhost:5000
